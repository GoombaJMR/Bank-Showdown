Minigame that I am working on here and there.
It's pretty simple, but the people who have played it have said that it's pretty intense!

I can't wait to do more with this... maybe even play with Turtle/Tkinter to add graphcis when the time comes...

More details soon.

-------------------------------
I've finished working on the single player mode for Bank Trouble! It's been a couple months, but I've found the time to play with it some more. I made the easy difficulty pretty easy and random (literally), the normal mode a tiny bit tricky, and the hard mode pretty difficult. I have yet to find an easy way to defeat the hard mode, which shows how hard it is.

If you would like to try the game, simply download the script and run it with ./BankShowdown.py
This was written in Python 3.6, and for mac or other users, you might need permission to run it. You can do that with the following:
  ~$ chmod 777 BankShowdown.py

If you have any questions, requests for more difficulties or whatever, then ask!!

Thanks,
